# CS187

My code for the assigned projects of CS187, a course that introduces and develops methods for designing and implementing abstract data types using Java. Project overviews taken from the instructions provided by the professor, as well as the grade I received on each project, is provided below.

_Note that the exact code that I have written would be under the TODO sections of each project._

## Project 1 - Getting Started



_Grade: 12/12_

## Project 2 - RLE Encoding



Grade: 60/60

## Project 3 - Bucket Sort


Grade: 95/95

## Project 4 - Linked Lists

In this project, you will write a linked-based implementation for the List abstract data type, as specified in ListInterface.java. Youâ€™ll be building a singly linked list that can act as a drone route. The requirement is all methods you implement must use recursion and you are NOT allowed to use any loop (such as for, while, do-while). You must also stay within Big-O runtime bounds so that the drones are efficient in delivering life essentials.

_Grade: 145/150; TODO sections in RecursiveList.java_
